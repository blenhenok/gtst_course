## information security 
- method and processes to protect information systems from unauthorized access, the disclosure  of information, usage or modification.
- ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability.

## terminologies 

### hack values 
its the target's level of attractiveness to the hacker.
### daisy chaining
its sequential process of attempts to gain access to a network or system, using the same info from previous attempts.
### vulnerability
weak point or loophole of a system.
### zero- day attack
vulnerability in a system unknown to its owners or developers.
### exploit
its a breach of security of system through vulnerabilities using different hacking methods.
### doxing
its publishing info associated with an individual. 
### payload
malicious code that causes harm to the targeted victim. such as exploit, opening backdoors
### bot
its software to execute predefined tasks and capable to run automated scripts over the internet. 

## elements of information security (CIA)
### confidentiality, integrity, availability
[[Day1_intro]]

### authenticity 
is the process that identifies the user or device to grant privileges and access.
### nonrepudiation
is the assurance and authenticity of the information. so the sender can not deny from what he sent and the receiver can not deny from receiving. via different techniques such as digital signatures, digital contracts and encryption. 

## information security threats and attack vectors

### cloud computing threats
- a single data breach can lead to breaching of multiple records over the cloud.
- data loss
- hijacking of account over the cloud and services.
- insecure API result of weak encryption and loopholes
### advanced persistent threats(APT)
- its the process of stealing information by a continuous process. 
- the persistent term defines the process of external command and controlling system that is continuously monitoring and fetching data from a target.
### viruses and worms
- viruses are malicious software developed to spread, replicate themselves and attach themselves to other files.
        - theses viruses require user interaction to trigger and initiate malicious activities on the resident system. 
- worms are capable of replicating themselves and spread very quickly. 
### insider attack
- attack performed within a corporate network. insider has privileges and authorized to access the network resources.
### botnet
- combination of functionality of robots and network develop a continuously working botnet on repetitive task.
- can get access to the system using malicious scripts or through spider.
- spider program crawl over the internet and searches for holes in security.it alerts master computer when the system is under control.

## information security threat categories 

### network threats
- network infrastructure are routers, switches and firewalls. these devices perform routing but also control and protect the running applications, servers and devices from attacks and intrusions.
- poorly configured devices offer intruder to exploit. common vulnerabilities include using default installation setting, open access control, wear encryption and password and devices lacking the latest security patches. 
### host threat
- focused on system software; that applications are built or running over. such as window, .net , SQL servers and others.
