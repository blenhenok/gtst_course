# Ethical hacking
- used as penetration testing to identify the vulnerabilities and risks to take remedial actions against attacks. 

## elements of information security
CIA  [[intro to ethical hacking]]
- ==confidentiality==: data should be available to those with authorized access.
- ==integrity== : the information should be intact, complete and accurate.
- ==availability== : the system or devices are ready to use as intended by the authorized person.

## phases of hacking
### reconnaissance
- initial preparing phase by gathering information about the target.
        - passive : acquiring information without directly interacting with the target. ex.  using social media.
        - active : by acquiring the target directly. ex. via calls, emails or help desk.
### scanning
- scanning the network by using the info we got earlier.
- by using tools like port scanners, network mappers and ping. 
### gaining access
- the point where the hacker gets control or access.
### maintaining access
- maintaining the access and control over the compromised system.
### clearing tracks or logs
- the attacker must hide his identity by covering the tracks to continue the access to the system and remain un noticed 

## types of pen testing
>black box pen testing : without prior knowledge  about the thing we are hacking
>white box pen testing : with prior knowledge , u test as developer.
>grey box: with little knowledge.

## terms
> red team: attack
> blue team : defensive
> vulnerability assessment: security check
> security audit: evaluation of the security or control
