# Script
- A script or scripting language is a computer language with several commands within a file capable of being executed without being compiled. Examples of server-side scripting languages include Perl, PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor), and Python. The best example of a client-side scripting language is JavaScript.
## Script installation 
- Some hacking tools are developed by some peoples and those peoples make it open-source, that means we can get those scripts/programs from GitHub. So we can download and use it. For this purpose git have a feature called ‘clone’
- Syntax
     ` git clone 'link_of_the_script_from_github' `

- So when we use these programming languages to do tasks their is something called modules/libraries these are needed to run the script as the dependencies.
**Example:**
1. Python: to install python modules we use `pip install 'module_name'` 
    - For requirements file -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
2. Go: to install go modules -> `go install 'module_name'`

3. Ruby:  to install ruby modules -> `gem install 'module_name'`
