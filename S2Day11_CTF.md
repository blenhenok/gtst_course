# Capture The Flag ( CTF )

- CTF is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. 
- In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. **This goal is called the flag**, hence the name!
# CTF Types
- There are 3 types of CTF
- **Attack- Defense**
    - In these types of events, teams defend a host PC while still trying to attack opposing teams’ target PCs.
    - Each team starts off with an allotted time for patching and securing the PC, trying to discover as many vulnerabilities as possible before the opponent attacking teams can strike. 
    - The team with the most points wins.
- **Jeopardy CTF**
    - Jeopardy-style CTFs present competitors with a set of questions that reveal clues(Hints) that guide them in solving complex tasks in a specific order.
    - By revealing clues, contestants learn the right direction regarding techniques and methodologies that are needed going forward. 
    - The more difficult the task, the more points you can earn upon its successful completion.
    - Ongoing, online CTF competitions are most likely to be Jeopardy style. It’s easier to play solo and requires less coordination among players than an Attack and Defend competition.
- **King of the Hill**
    - This kind of CTF is played in a team, the first who hacked the system and patched it will be the winner.
    - Here the player will act like red team and blue team. And will hack it and also patch it to prevent other competitors(hacker) from getting into the system.
# CTF categories 
- ***Web***: This type of challenges focus on finding and exploiting the vulnerabilities in web application. The maybe testing the participants’ knowledge on SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and many more.
- ***Forensic***: Participants need to investigate some sort of data, like do a packet analysis on .pcap file, log analysis, and so on.
- ***Cryptography***: Challenges will focus on decrypting encrypted strings from various types of cryptography such as Substitution crypto, Caesar cipher, and many more.
- ***Reversing***: RE usually needs participants to explore a given binary file weather PE file, ELF file, APK, or some types of other executable binary. Participants need to find the key by decomplication, disassemble using static or dynamic analysis, or other reverse engineering tools.
- ***OSINT***: The OSINT idea is to see how much information is available to you and understand the underlying hint’s hidden in the challenges it-self with the help of google and bit problem-solving skills. So more tools like sherlock, and no focus on domain enumeration, etc.
- ***Secure code***: A code is given and the game is to find the weak spot then changing that and running it will give the flag
- ***Web3***: This focus on the latest technology blockchain, you will find bug on smart contracts and so on
- ***Boot2root***: Here you will be given a IP address and the game is to find any bug and hacking that server/computer
## Reverse engineering
- Reverse Engineering is one of the greatest Cyber Security Field. As the name suggests we will reverse any thing that is built up.
- Here Hackers will reverse engineer and Bypass many things, like the last time burp licensing.
- Every thing we use Software are cracked by reverse engineers.
- For this You have to learn programming languages like, Assembly and C 
- There are many tools used to reverse any software and get the assembly code for further review. 
- **Example**: IDA, Ghidra, …
- And White hats, use this skill to reverse any malwares and to analyze it.
## Why play CTF?
- CTF games will give you a vulnerable Host, This will help you to learn the theory u got in practice.
- CTF will develop your hacker mindset and changes the way your mind works and think. it will make you ready for the real world hack. means , there are many kind of strength for the game, Easy, medium, Hard   ->  as a beginner you will try with Easy but after some time you will be on the hard, this will develop you hacking skill and ability ( as we all know hacking needs more practice)
- Will Teach you Patience, Because CTF’s are not quite simple sometimes they need patience. Through time you will learn that.
- Nowadays, CTF problems are asked in job interviews to test the skills of professionals. So, taking participation in the CTF contest may help you prepare for the cybersecurity job interviews as well.
- While playing CTF, you will learn how to handle pressure while honing your ethical hacking skills. You learn new creative ways to solve the problems.
- CTFs events serve as an opportunity for the white hat hackers to evaluate their skills and get recognition.
- CTF organizers also provide financial incentives, lucrative prizes to the winners.
## Point scoring
- here are two types of Scorings.
    - **Static points**: is a CTF that have a limited CTF point
    - **Dynamic points**:  is a CTF that have an increasing point. The one who got the flag 1st will have the highest point.
- A user got flags for the 1st time is called “ FIRST BLOOD!”
## How to play CTF?
- CTF’s are played in different places. In universities, Online, in person ,in military… But the game is same, you just find a flag.
- There are easy CTFs, but as the CTF got harder. You have to combine many knowledges together to get the flag.
- Example: if there is a web ctf and when you hack the web the web have some vulnerability called “Command injection”( it is a web vuln that will lead to any command executions) then for the command u have to have a linux knowledge, then when u got the flag in a text file, it might be encoded in base64 so, here u need cryptography knowledge.
- To play ctf online we can use some websites for free. These websites are a Good place to learn hacking too. They have labs, and walkthroughs
- Walkthrough: is a kind of question and answer but it will walk you through every steps by teaching you so you will have the knowledge by playing the CTF.
