# Social engineering
- Social engineering refers to the manipulation of people into taking actions that compromise their security or privacy. It exploits human psychology and emotions rather than technical vulnerabilities.
- It applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering or computer system access; in most cases the attacker never comes face-to-face with the victim
### Why Social Engineering Works
- The purpose of social engineering is usually to secretly install spyware, other malicious software or to trick persons into handing over passwords and/or other sensitive financial or personal information
- Exploits human emotions (curiosity, fear, trust) and instincts.
- Targets cognitive biases (e.g., authority bias, urgency bias).
- Manipulates victims into taking actions that benefit the attacker.
# Types of social engineering 
- Based on how we do the social engineering attack, it is classified into many kinds.
## Phishing
- Phishing is tricking people into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by pretend to be someone one is not as a trustworthy source. 
- Scammers send deceptive emails or messages, pretending to be trusted entities (e.g., coworkers, banks, or government agencies). Victims may unknowingly share sensitive information or download malicious attachments.
- Phishing messages will usually contain a link that takes the user to a fake website that looks like the real thing. The user is then asked to enter personal information, such as their credit card number. This information is then used to steal the person’s identity or to make charges on their credit card.
- common types of phishing:
    - **Normal Phishing**: this is an attach that tries to fool any victim.
    - **Spear Phishing**: Is a an attack that is planned and made for some person with specific loving and mindset
- Phishing scams also come in a few different delivery forms:
    - **Email phishing** is one of the most traditional phishing methods and is often spam sent to many people at once.
    - **Shoulder surfing** is a physical technique used to obtain/get information by directly looking some ones computer screen/keypad. When we enter our password, we might say don't look at me that is shoulder surfing.
    - **Vishing (voice phishing)** is when a phisher calls or leaves a voicemail pretending to be from a trusted institution in hopes of gaining private information.
    - **Smishing (SMS phishing)** involves sending texts containing malicious links or probing for personal information.
    - **URL phishing** is when a phisher sends a link to a fake website that looks legitimate to the victim. When the victim clicks the link, they’re asked to provide private details that can be harvested by the attacker.
    - **In-session phishing** occurs when a victim is actively signed into an account or platform and a fake pop-up appears asking them to sign in again or to provide other sensitive information. It usually occurs on sites that don’t use https encryption.
    - **Dumpster Diving** Is a technique for getting data is a dumpsters or recycle bins. Old companies work was with papers, so when they finish with these papers whey will through them to the dumpster/basket. If hacker got that dumpster, and if those papers have some secret information, or company workers name with the Job they intended to do, it will make the attack wider.
## Pretexting 
- it is an attack in which the attacker creates a scenario to try and convince the victim to give up valuable information, such as a password.
- common pretexting attacks example:
    - **Romance scam**  is a type of social engineering attack that manipulates feelings like love. A scammer may pretend to be an online love interest in such a pretexting scam, taking weeks if not months to win the target’s confidence. Ultimately, they may ask for a large loan for an emergency, plane ticket, or a gift.
    - **Cryptocurrency scam** Hackers are tricking people interested in investing in cryptocurrency with pretexting scams by pretending to be wealthy and experienced investors.  After telling their targets tall tales of financial rewards, they convince them to “invest” in crypto with them. Once the scammers receive the money, they disappear.
    - **Whaling attack** Such hackers either pretend to be company leaders to target employees or directly target high-level players(CEO) in an organization.  Here, they may gain secret information or a sizable financial payment by using the pretext of a business deal.

- To get the data from those highly secured social medias, we have to hack Directly the companies , but that is very difficult todo. 
- WHY is it difficult? Because
    - Their Security is Hard to broke
    - Their System is Safeguarded
    - Their Employees are Learnt
- So, to Hack those social media we need some vuln/weakest point, WHAT IS THE WEAKEST LINK?
    - **HUMAN BEINGS(HOSTS)**: Here, the vulnerability we got on those companies is The users/the host  so here we can use the social engineering attacks.
