1. decimal representation of the subnet mask for CIDR: 10.200.20.0/27 = 255.255.255.224

2. the broadcasting address for CIDR: 10.200.20.0/27 = 10.200.20.31

3. 3rd subnet of 10.200.20.0/27 of the 4 subnets
- To create four subnets, we need to borrow two additional bits from the host portion of the original /27 subnet.The subnet mask for the new subnets will be /29 (since 2^2 = 4).
- Letâ€™s calculate the subnets:
Subnet 1: 10.200.20.0/29
Subnet 2: 10.200.20.8/29
Subnet 3: 10.200.20.16 (This is the network address of the 3rd subnet!)
Subnet 4: 10.200.20.24/29

4.broadcasting address of the 2nd subnet of 10.200.20.0/27 of the 4 subnets
The broadcast address is always the last address in a subnet.
For the 2nd subnet (10.200.20.8/29), the broadcast address is 10.200.20.15.
