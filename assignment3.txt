1. decimal representation of the subnet mask for CIDR: 10.200.20.0/27 = 255.255.255.224
because- CLASS C = N.N.N.H = 24 bits = 255.255.255.0
27 - 24  = 3bits = 11100000 = 224 0n the last octet


2. the broadcasting address for CIDR: 10.200.20.0/27 = 10.200.20.31
because - since the last N/ID is 3 bits = 8 subnets can be created
#host IP = 2^5 - 2 = 32-2=30
host range = 10.200.20.1 - 10.200.20.30
# since broadcasting Ip is the last IP in the subnet range = 10.200.20.31

3. 3rd subnet of 10.200.20.0/27 of the 4 subnets
- To create four subnets, we need to borrow two additional bits from the host portion of the original /27 subnet.The subnet mask for the new subnets will be /29 (since 2^2 = 4).
- Letâ€™s calculate the subnets:
Subnet 1: 10.200.20.0/29
Subnet 2: 10.200.20.8/29
Subnet 3: 10.200.20.16 (This is the network address of the 3rd subnet!)
Subnet 4: 10.200.20.24/29

4.broadcasting address of the 2nd subnet of 10.200.20.0/27 of the 4 subnets
The broadcast address is always the last address in a subnet.
For the 2nd subnet (10.200.20.8/29), the broadcast address is 10.200.20.15.
