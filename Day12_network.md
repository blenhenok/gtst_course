# Introduction to networking
- A network consists of two or more entities or objects sharing resources and information.
- A computer network consists of two or more computing devices connected to each other to share resources and information.
- The network becomes a powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.
- Computers on a network can act as a client or a server.

### client computer
- **client** is a device or software application that requests services or resources from another computer on the network, called a server. Clients typically have less processing power and memory than servers and rely on servers to provide them with data and services. Examples of client devices include personal computers, smartphones, and tablets. Examples of client software applications include web browsers, email clients, and file transfer clients.
### server computers
- they are devices or software applications that provide services or resources to clients on the network. Servers typically have more processing power and memory than clients and are designed to handle multiple requests from clients simultaneously. Examples of server devices include web servers, email servers, and file servers. Examples of server software applications include web server software, email server software, and database server software.

# classification of networks

## Based on geographic spread
- Networks are frequently classified according to the geographical boundaries spanned by the network itself.

1. **LAN(local area network)**: LAN is a computer network that consists of few or more computers and other communication devices connected in the form of a network within a well-defined area such as a room or a building.
    - LANs are inexpensive to install and also provide higher speeds.
2. **MAN(Metropolitan area network)**: MAN is a network more extensive than a LAN, and it can cover a relatively larger area of a city, from a few tens to a maximum of hundred kilometers.
    - The cost of installation and operation is higher.
    - MANs use high-speed connections such as fiber optics to achieve higher speeds
3. **WAN(wide area network)**: WAN is a computer network that spans a large geographical area and uses dedicated or switched connections to link computers in geographically remote locations. There are three categories of WANs: Enterprise network, Global network, and Internet.
    - WANs span a larger area than a single city.
    - These use long distance telecommunication networks for connection, thereby increasing the cost.

## Based on component roles
- Networks can also be classified according to the roles that the networked computers play in the network’s operation.

1. **Peer to peer:** all devices on the network have equal status and can act as both clients and servers. 
    - Each device can request services or resources from other devices on the network and provide services or resources to other devices on the network. 
    - Examples of peer-to-peer networks include file-sharing networks and online gaming networks.
    - Peer-to-peer networks are cheap and easy to install.
    - They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.
    - Most operating systems come with built-in peer-to-peer networking capability.
    - The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer network is ten.
2. **Server based**: provide services or resources to clients on the network. offers centralized control and is designed for secure operations.
    - Servers typically have more processing power and memory than clients and are
    - designed to handle multiple requests from clients simultaneously.
    - A dedicated server is one that services the network by storing data, applications, resources, and also provides access to resources required by the client.
3. **Client based:** clients request services or resources from servers, and servers provide those services or resources to clients.

# IP (internet protocol) address
- An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network.
- IP (Internet Protocol) is a Network Layer Protocol.

## IPv4 ( Internet protocol version 4)
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit sequence of 1s and 0s.
- To make the IP address easier to use, the address is usually written as four decimal numbers separated by periods. 
- This way of writing the address is called the dotted decimal format.
- IP generated by DHCP or Manually.

### IP structure
- every Ip has four section. each section is 8bit long.
- each section can range from 0 - 255.
*1 section = 1 byte = 8 bits*
*4 sections = 4 bytes = 32 bits*
**Example:**  192.168.123.12
